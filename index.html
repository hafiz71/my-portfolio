            <p>I am just learning for programmig. Now my position is that only coding student. In future I want to a top class webDevs InshaAllah. I always pray to Allah "Allam Homma Inni Asalukal Afaiha" that means "Allah always donate wellness". Becoming a programmer will definitely be easier if you have the right educational background in the basics of computer technology and logic, and mathematics (obviously). If you lack this educational foundation, you can learn things on the go, but that will require more time and more effort on your part.</p>
